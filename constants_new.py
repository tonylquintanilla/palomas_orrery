    "and animated plots over different time periods, using real-time data from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Horizons System " 
    "to plot actual positions. Complete idealized orbits of planets, asteroids, dwarf planets, and Kuiper belt objects are also "
    "calculated from their orbital parameters using Kepler's equations. \n\n" 

    "STELLAR NEIGHBORHOOD VISUALIZATION:\n"
    "Explore our cosmic neighborhood in four different ways: by distance (light-years) or brightness (apparent magnitude), "
    "displayed in either 2D Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams or immersive 3D spatial plots. Plot stars up to 100 light-years away "
    "to see the actual 3D structure and beginning shape of our galaxy!\n\n" 

    "DISTANCE MODE: See all stars within your selected distance from the Sun, revealing the true 3D structure of our local "
    "stellar neighborhood. MAGNITUDE MODE: View stars by apparent brightness (how bright they appear to us), including "
    "distant luminous giants thousands of light-years away alongside nearby dim stars. At higher magnitudes, you'll begin "
    "to see the galaxy's shape and tilt! Warning: Higher magnitudes fetch more stars and take longer to plot.\n\n"

    "3D SPATIAL PLOTS: Experience stars in their actual 3D positions relative to the Sun. Use 'Move Camera to the Center' "
    "to view from the Sun's position and see familiar constellations like Orion with M42 (Orion Nebula)! Toggle between "
    "detailed hover information and star names only for clarity.\n\n"
    
    "2D HERTZSPRUNG-RUSSELL DIAGRAMS: The classic scientific plot showing stellar luminosity vs. temperature, revealing "
    "stellar types and evolutionary stages. Discover main sequence stars, giants, supergiants, and white dwarfs!\n\n" 

    "MESSIER OBJECTS: In magnitude mode, plot famous non-stellar objects like nebulae, star clusters, and galaxies alongside "
    "the stars. Perfect for exploring deep-sky objects visible to amateur astronomers!\n\n"

    "ENHANCED PLANETARY SYSTEM (2025 UPDATE):\n"
    "NEW! Comprehensive planetary interior visualization with individual shell structures for all major solar system bodies. "
    "Toggle individual components like planetary cores, mantles, atmospheres, radiation belts, and plasma tori. The Sun is "
    "visualized in unprecedented detail: core, radiative zone, convective zone, photosphere, chromosphere, inner/outer corona, "
    "solar wind boundaries, termination shock, and heliopause. Manually select 100,000 AU scale to explore the vast "
    "inner and outer Oort clouds - the source of comets!\n\n"

    "ADVANCED SPACECRAFT TRACKING (2025 UPDATE):\n"
    "Follow historic and active missions including Parker Solar Probe (touching the Sun's corona!), completed OSIRIS-REx "
    "sample return from Bennu, ongoing OSIRIS-APEX mission to Apophis, Voyager 1&2 in interstellar space, Pioneer probes, "
    "Galileo, Cassini, SOHO, Gaia, BepiColombo, Solar Orbiter, and many more. Watch real trajectories unfold over time!\n\n"

    "ROBUST DATA MANAGEMENT (2025 UPDATE):\n"
    "Enhanced cache system with automatic validation, repair, and backup capabilities. Multi-threaded processing ensures "
    "smooth performance while intelligent interval selection optimizes data fetching. Export capabilities include HTML, "
    "PNG, JSON, VOTable, and Pickle formats for sharing and analysis.\n\n"

    "INTERACTIVE FEATURES:\n"
    "â¢ Animation: Watch solar system evolution from minutes to years\n"

    "SOLAR SYSTEM OBJECTS:\n"
    "The scrollable selection menu includes planets, moons (including all major Jovian and Saturnian satellites), asteroids, "
    "trans-Neptunian objects, comets (including recent discoveries like interstellar visitor C/2025 N1), and active/historic "
    "spacecraft missions. Select multiple objects to compare their motions and relationships.\n\n"

    "DATA AVAILABILITY & TIMEFRAMES:\n"
    "Mission and comet data availability varies by object and time period. For spacecraft and comets, carefully select dates "
    "within available data ranges to avoid plotting errors. The Horizons system provides data through 2199-12-29 for most "
    "objects. Long-period objects like Sedna show partial actual positions plus complete idealized orbits calculated from "
    "orbital parameters.\n\n"

    "COORDINATE SYSTEM:\n"
    "Positions use the J2000 ecliptic coordinate system, aligned with Earth's orbital plane and fixed relative to stars as "
    "of January 1, 2000. Coordinates are measured in Astronomical Units (AU) - approximately 149.6 million kilometers or "
    "the average Earth-Sun distance.\n\n"

    "PERFORMANCE TIPS:\n"
    "â¢ Use 'Move Camera to Center' to view from the Sun's perspective\n"
    "â¢ Reduce distance/magnitude limits for less crowded, more detailed views\n"
    "â¢ Toggle hover text complexity based on your needs\n"
    "â¢ Be patient with complex plots - quality visualization takes time!\n"
    "â¢ Ensure active internet connection for real-time data fetching\n\n"

        '  Sun with parameters very similar to Earth\'s, appearing to "dance" around our planet in a looping, oscillating path. While it\'s \n' 
        '  too distant to be gravitationally bound like a true moon, it remains relatively close to Earth, between 38 and 100 times the \n' 
        '  distance of the Moon. Its orbit is relatively stable and is expected to remain in this configuration for hundreds of thousands of years.\n' 
        '* Physical Characteristics: Kamo\'oalewa is estimated to be between 40-100 meters in diameter, making it one of the smallest \n' 
        '  asteroids ever targeted for a mission. It\'s also a fast rotator, completing a rotation in approximately 28 minutes.\n' 
        '* Mysterious Origin: One of the most intriguing aspects of Kamo\'oalewa is its potential origin. Research suggests that its \n' 
        '  reflected light spectrum matches lunar rocks from NASA\'s Apollo missions. This has led to the hypothesis that Kamo\'oalewa \n' 
        '  might be a fragment of our own Moon, ejected by an ancient impact. Confirmation of this theory through sample analysis would be \n' 
        '  groundbreaking, as no other known asteroid has been definitively linked to lunar origins.\n' 
        '* Tianwen-2 Mission: Tianwen-2 is China\'s ambitious deep space mission designed to explore asteroid Kamo\'oalewa and a main-belt \n' 
        '  comet. The Tianwen-2 mission launched on May 28, 2025. The mission\'s initial target is Kamo\'oalewa. Tianwen-2 will rendezvous \n' 
        '  with the asteroid in mid-2026 and spend about nine months in its vicinity. It aims to collect approximately 100 grams of \n' 
        '  regolith (surface material) using both "touch-and-go" and "anchor-and-attach" methods. The "anchor-and-attach" method would be \n' 
        '  a first for asteroid sampling. The collected samples are planned to be returned to Earth in November 2027. Analyzing these \n' 
        '  samples will be crucial in determining Kamo\'oalewa\'s true origin (e.g., lunar fragment or main-belt asteroid) and providing \n'

        '  more circular path:\n' 
        '  * L3\'s Unstable and Collinear Nature: L3, like L1 and L2, lies along the line connecting the two primary bodies (Sun and Earth-Moon Barycenter in \n' 
        '      this case). These collinear points are inherently unstable equilibrium points. Any slight perturbation (and there are \n' 
        '      many in the real solar system, from other planets, the Moon\'s wobble, solar wind pressure, etc.) will cause a body at \n' 
        '      L3 to drift away from the exact point.\n' 
        '  * "Hidden" from View: SEMB-L3 is on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth. It\'s essentially orbiting the Sun at approximately the same \n' 
        '      distance as Earth, but 180 degrees out of phase.\n' 
        '  * The Dominant Influence of the Sun: The Sun\'s gravity is overwhelming. L3 is essentially a point that "tries" to stay at the same solar orbital distance as \n' 
        '      Earth, but because it\'s behind the Sun, the gravitational pull from the Earth (and Moon) is very subtle and often \n' 
        '      insufficient to perfectly hold it in a perfectly symmetric orbit around the Sun.\n' 
        '  * Perturbations from Other Planets: While L1, L2, L4, and L5 also experience perturbations, L3 is particularly sensitive. The gravitational tugs from Venus, \n' 
        '      Jupiter, and other planets, even though small, can have a noticeable effect on the precise location of the unstable L3 \n' 
        '      point. These perturbations will cause L3\'s ideal position to constantly shift slightly, resulting in an "irregular" or \n' 
        '      "wobbly" path when observed over time.\n' 
        '  * Influence of the Moon\'s Orbit: Even though we use the Earth-Moon Barycenter (EMB) as the secondary body for SEMB-L* calculations, the Moon\'s actual \n' 
        '      orbit around the Earth means that the "effective" secondary mass is constantly shifting slightly relative to the ideal \n' 
        '      EMB point. This introduces a small, but continuous, perturbation on all the SEMB-L* points, which is more noticeable for \n' 
        '      the unstable ones like L3.\n' 
        '  *Reference Frame and "Ideal" Orbit: When you plot the L-points, you\'re usually plotting their positions in an inertial frame (like the Solar System Barycenter \n' 
        '      frame). In this frame: SEMB-L1 and SEMB-L2 will generally track along the Earth-Moon Barycenter\'s orbit, staying on the \n' 
        '      line between the Sun and the EMB. SEMB-L4 and SEMB-L5 are the stable points. In an idealized circular restricted three-body \n' 
        '      problem, they would form equilateral triangles with the two primaries and trace the same perfect circular orbit as the \n' 
        '      secondary. In reality, they also exhibit small, stable librations (oscillations) around the ideal points, but their overall \n' 
        '      path will closely follow the EMB\'s orbit. SEMB-L3\'s instability means it doesn\'t settle into such a neat pattern of \n' 
        '      librations. Its position is constantly being nudged away from the ideal, resulting in a more complex, non-circular trajectory \n' 
        '      that reflects these ongoing instabilities and perturbations. In essence, L3 is highly sensitive to the "messiness" of the real \n' 
        '      solar system. While the mathematical definition of L3 exists, its physical location is constantly being pulled and pushed by \n' 
        '      various gravitational forces, leading to the irregular path you observed. It\'s a fantastic demonstration of the difference \n'

        'carbon and other organic molecules, as well as hydrated minerals. They are considered to be some of the most primitive ' 
        'objects in the solar system, essentially time capsules from the early days of our planetary system\'s formation.\n' 
        '* Size: Bennu is relatively small, with an equatorial diameter of about 510 meters. It\'s shaped somewhat like a spinning ' 
        'top or a lumpy potato.\n' 
        '* Rotation: Bennu rotates fairly quickly, completing a rotation every 4.3 hours.\n' 
        '* Orbit: Bennu\'s orbit brings it relatively close to Earth, making it accessible for a spacecraft mission. However, its orbit also crosses Earth\'s.\n' 
        '* Scientific Value: Carbonaceous asteroids like Bennu are believed to contain the building blocks of life - organic molecules, ' 
        'amino acids, and potentially even more complex compounds. Studying these materials can give us insights into the early solar ' 
        'system and the origins of life itself. Bennu is a pristine sample of this material.\n' 
        '* Accessibility: Bennu\'s near-Earth orbit made it a logistically feasible target for the OSIRIS-REx mission. The round trip was ' 
        'possible within a reasonable timeframe.\n' 
        '* Sample Return: The primary goal of OSIRIS-REx was to collect a sample of material from Bennu and return it to Earth. Bennu\'s ' 
        'size, composition, and relatively slow rotation made it a good candidate for a touch-and-go sample collection maneuver.\n' 
        'Planetary Defense: Studying Bennu also provides valuable information for planetary defense. Because it\'s a near-Earth asteroid, '

        '  such a vast timescale. \n' 
        '* The nickname "Ammonite" for asteroid 2023 KQ14 was given by the research team that discovered it as part of an international \n' 
        '  astronomical survey project called FOSSIL (Formation of the Outer Solar System: An Icy Legacy). The name "Ammonite" is a \n' 
        '  reference to the extinct marine animal known for its spiral shell. The nickname was chosen because the asteroid\'s unusual \n' 
        '  orbit is seen as a "fossil" that preserves a record of the early solar system\'s formation. Like a fossil, the asteroid\'s \n' 
        '  stable orbit provides clues about the conditions and gravitational forces present billions of years ago. \n'

        '    roughly 260 AU. It was the second sednoid discovered.\n' 
        '  * Scientific significance: The discovery of these objects is significant because their orbits are all highly detached from the \n' 
        '    gravitational influence of Neptune and appear to be unusually clustered in a similar orientation in space. This clustering is \n' 
        '    a primary piece of evidence supporting the hypothesis of a massive, undiscovered planetâoften called "Planet Nine"âthat is \n'

        'Apollo 11 S-IVB': 
        'MANUALLY SCALE TO 0.01 AU.\n'
        '* SPACECRAFT TRAJECTORY: The trajectory here is a reconstruction of the Apollo 11 S-IVB stage Earth departure trajectory ' 
        'developed by Daniel R. Adamo. The trajectory spans the time interval from 1969-Jul-16 16:40 to July 28 00:06 GMT/UTC.\n' 
        '* The Apollo 11 S-IVB spacecraft, as defined in this JPL Horizons ephemeris, refers to the third stage of the Saturn V rocket ' 
        'used for the Apollo 11 mission. This is the last and most powerful stage of the Saturn V rocket that propelled the Apollo 11 ' 
        'mission towards the Moon.\n' 
        '* Translunar Injection (TLI): It fired its engine a second time (after the initial Earth orbit insertion burn) to accelerate ' 
        'the Apollo 11 command/service module (CSM) and lunar module (LM) out of Earth orbit and onto a trajectory towards the Moon.\n' 
        '* Departure from Earth-Moon space: After TLI and the separation of the CSM/LM, the S-IVB stage performed "residual propellant ' 
        'dumps." This maneuver caused it to approach the Moon and then depart Earth-Moon space on a heliocentric trajectory, while ' 
        'the manned Apollo 11 mission continued to the Moon.\n' 
        '* Not the manned part of Apollo 11: It\'s crucial to distinguish the S-IVB stage from the Apollo 11 Command Module, Lunar ' 
        'Module, and the astronauts themselves, who continued on to the Moon and returned to Earth. The S-IVB stage was a discarded ' 
        'part of the rocket that went on its own separate path.\n' 
        '  * Launch, July 16, 13:32:00: This is the moment the Saturn V rocket, carrying the Apollo 11 spacecraft, lifted ' 
        'off from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. This marked the official start of the mission.\n' 
        '  * Earth orbit insertion, July 16, 13:43:49: After the first two stages of the Saturn V had expended their fuel ' 
        'and separated, the third stage (the S-IVB) ignited to place the Apollo spacecraft (Command/Service Module and Lunar Module) ' 
        'into a parking orbit around Earth. This allowed for final checks and preparation before the journey to the Moon.\n' 
        '  * Translunar injection (TLI), July 16, 16:22:13: This was a critical burn of the S-IVB engine. After orbiting Earth ' 
        'for about 2.5 hours, the S-IVB reignited to provide the immense thrust needed to accelerate the Apollo spacecraft out of ' 
        'Earth orbit and onto a trajectory that would take it to the Moon. This "injection" set the spacecraft on its path across ' 
        'the cislunar space.\n' 
        '  * CSM-LM docking, July 16, 16:56:03:\n' 
        '    * CSM: Command/Service Module. This was the main spacecraft component that housed the three astronauts for most of the mission.\n' 
        '    * The Command Module (CM) was the crew\'s living quarters, control center, and the only part that returned to Earth.\n' 
        '    * The Service Module (SM) contained the main propulsion system, fuel, oxygen, and other consumables. It was jettisoned before re-entry.\n' 
        '    * LM: Lunar Module. This was the two-stage spacecraft designed to land two astronauts on the Moon\'s surface.\n' 
        '    * Explanation: After TLI, the CSM separated from the S-IVB stage. The CSM then turned around, faced the LM (which was still ' 
        'attached to the S-IVB), and carefully docked nose-to-nose with it. This maneuver was crucial for extracting the LM from ' 
        'the S-IVB and preparing for the lunar landing phase. After docking, the combined CSM-LM pulled away from the S-IVB.\n' 
        '  * Lunar orbit insertion, July 19, 17:21:50: After a three-day journey from Earth, the Apollo 11 spacecraft ' 
        '(CSM and LM still docked together) fired its main engine (on the Service Module) to slow down sufficiently and enter ' 
        'orbit around the Moon. This placed them in a stable elliptical orbit from which the landing attempt could be made.\n' 
        '  * CSM-LM separation, July 20, 06:11:53: With the combined spacecraft in lunar orbit, the two active modules ' 
        'separated. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were inside the Lunar Module ("Eagle"), while Michael Collins remained in the ' 
        'Command Module ("Columbia") orbiting the Moon. This was the final step before the lunar landing attempt.\n' 
        '  * Lunar landing, July 20, 08:17:40: The Lunar Module, piloted by Armstrong and Aldrin, began its descent from ' 
        'lunar orbit. After a tense, manually piloted final approach, the LM "Eagle" successfully touched down on the Moon\'s '
        'surface in the Sea of Tranquility. This marked the first time humans landed on an extraterrestrial body.\n' 
        '  * Begin EVA, July 20, 14:39:33: Extravehicular Activity. This refers to any activity performed by an astronaut ' 
        'outside a spacecraft. In this context, it specifically means stepping out of the Lunar Module onto the Moon\'s surface.\n '
        'After landing, Armstrong and Aldrin spent several hours preparing the LM for their spacewalk. This event marks the beginning ' 
        'of their preparations to exit the LM and begin their surface exploration.\n' 
        '  * First step on surface, July 20, 14:56:15: Neil Armstrong emerged from the Lunar Module and became the first ' 
        'human to step onto the Moon\'s surface, uttering the famous words, "That\'s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." ' 
        'Buzz Aldrin joined him shortly after.\n' 
        '  * Lunar liftoff, July 21, 17:54:01: After about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface, the ascent stage of the Lunar ' 
        'Module (carrying Armstrong and Aldrin) fired its engine, leaving the descent stage behind on the Moon. This propelled them ' 
        'back into lunar orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module.\n' 
        '  * LM-CSM docking, July 21, 09:34:00: The Lunar Module ascent stage successfully rendezvoused with the Command ' 
        'Module, still piloted by Michael Collins in lunar orbit. The two spacecraft then docked, allowing Armstrong and Aldrin ' 
        'to transfer back into the Command Module with their lunar samples. The LM ascent stage was then jettisoned into lunar orbit.\n' 
        '  * Transearth injection, July 21, 16:54:42: With all three astronauts safely aboard the Command Module, its main ' 
        'engine was fired one last time. This "injection" burn accelerated the Command Module out of lunar orbit and set it on a ' 
        'course back to Earth.\n' 
        '  * Splashdown, July 24, 16:50:35: After a journey of about 2.5 days from the Moon, the Command Module (the only ' 
        'part of the spacecraft designed to return to Earth) entered Earth\'s atmosphere, deployed its parachutes, and successfully ' 
        'landed in the Pacific Ocean. The Apollo 11 astronauts splashed down in the Pacific Ocean 2660 km east of Wake Island, 280 '

        '* Extended Mission: Instead of retiring the spacecraft, NASA decided to extend the mission and send it to another asteroid, ' 
        'Apophis. This new mission was named OSIRIS-APEX (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security - '

        'It was a breathtaking sight for observers.\n * Post-1965: The comet faded from view as it moved away from the Sun. ' 
        'Though it\'s still out there, with an orbital period estimated to be roughly 880 years, we won\'t see it again for a ' 
        'very long time.',
        
        'West': 'Horizons: C/1975 V1. Comet West, formally designated C/1975 V1-A, was a dazzling celestial visitor that became one of the most brilliant ' 
        'comets of the 20th century. \n' 
        '* Often referred to as a "great comet," it captivated observers in 1976 with its exceptional brightness, even becoming ' 
        '  visible to the naked eye during daylight hours at its peak. \n' 
        '* Discovered by Danish astronomer Richard M. West on August 10, 1975, at the European Southern Observatory in Chile, the ' 
        '  comet was initially a faint object. However, as it journeyed closer to the sun, its brightness increased dramatically. By ' 
        '  the time it reached its closest approach to the sun (perihelion) on February 25, 1976, it had transformed into a spectacular ' 
        '  sight.\n' 
        '* For a brief period, Comet West\'s brilliance rivaled that of the planet Venus, reaching an apparent magnitude of -3. This ' 
        '  allowed for the rare spectacle of observing a comet in the daytime sky. Its broad, fan-shaped dust tail and a separate, slender ' 
        '  plasma tail stretched across the heavens, creating a truly memorable display for those who witnessed it.\n' 
        '* Shortly after its perihelion passage, in early March 1976, observations revealed that the comet\'s core had broken into at least ' 
        '  four distinct pieces. This breakup was likely caused by the immense thermal and gravitational stresses it experienced during its ' 
        '  close encounter with the sun.\n' 
        '* Comet West started as a long-period comet, meaning it followed a highly elliptical orbit from far beyond the outer reaches of ' 
        '  our solar system. Its orbit is also highly inclined relative to the plane of the planets.\n' 
        '  * The "Original" Orbit (Before Entry): This is the path the comet was on before it entered the planetary region of our solar ' 
        '    system. For Comet West, this original orbit was a very long-period ellipse. Eccentricity (e): ~0.999996 (less than 1). ' 
        '    It was a bound member of the solar system, destined to return.\n' 
        '  * The "Future" Orbit (After Exit): This is the path the comet is on after swinging by the Sun and getting a gravitational ' 
        '    "kick" from the planets. As Comet West passed through, the gravity of the giant planets acted like a slingshot, ' 
        '    accelerating it. This slight increase in energy was enough to change its orbit from a closed ellipse to an open hyperbola. ' 
        '    Eccentricity (e): ~1.00001 (greater than 1). It is now on an escape trajectory and will be ejected from the solar system, ' 
        '    never to return.\n' 
        '  * In short: Comet West came in on an elliptical path but is going out on a hyperbolic one. It was a long-term member of our ' 
        '    solar system that has now been permanently kicked out.',
                
        'Halley': 'Horizons: 1P/Halley. Most famous comet, returns every 76 years. ' 
        '* Orbital Period and Characteristics: Halley\'s Comet has an average orbital period of 76 Earth years. However, this period ' 
        'can vary due to the gravitational influence of planets, particularly Jupiter and Saturn.  In fact, the gravitational pull ' 
        'of the major planets alters the orbital period from revolution to revolution. Measured from one perihelion passage to the ' 
        'next, Halley\'s period has been as short as 74.42 years (1835-1910) and as long as 79.25 years (451-530).\n' 
        '* Orbit Path: The comet\'s orbit is highly elliptical, with an eccentricity of ' 
        '0.967. This means its path around the Sun takes it from a point relatively close to the Sun (perihelion) to a point far ' 
        'beyond Neptune\'s orbit (aphelion).\n' 
        '* Orbit is Retrograde: Halley\'s Comet orbits the Sun in a retrograde direction, opposite to the direction of most planets. ' 
        'Its orbit is also inclined by 18 degrees to the ecliptic, the plane of Earth\'s orbit.\n' 
        '* History of Observations: Halley\'s Comet has been observed and recorded by astronomers for millennia. Before Halley\'s ' 
        'prediction of its return in 1705, these appearances were not recognized as being the same object. Ancient civilizations, ' 
        'particularly the Chinese, meticulously documented cometary appearances, providing valuable historical records.  It is a ' 
        'remarkable fact that observations made with the naked eye 2,000 years ago are still of value today. In the centuries ' 
        'leading up to Halley\'s prediction, observations from China, Babylon, and Europe helped to track the comet\'s appearances. ' 
        'These observations, even those made with the naked eye, have proven valuable for modern astronomers studying the comet\'s ' 
        'long-term behavior.\n' 
        '  * The comet\'s appearance in 1066, shortly before the Norman Conquest of England, is perhaps its most famous historical ' 
        'sighting. It was depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry, a significant historical artifact. It is said that William the Conqueror ' 
        'believed the comet heralded his success.\n' 
        '  * The 1910 apparition of Halley\'s Comet was also notable, as it was the first time the comet was captured on camera.\n' 
        '  * The 1986 apparition marked a turning point in our understanding of comets. For the first time, spacecraft were sent ' 
        'to encounter a comet, providing close-up images and data about its nucleus and composition. This included:\n' 
        '    * Giotto (European Space Agency), which provided the first close-up images of the nucleus.\n' 
        '    * Vega 1 and 2 (Soviet Union), which provided data and images.\n' 
        '    * Suisei and Sakigake (Japan). These probes studied the comet\'s coma and tail.\n' 
        '    * International Cometary Explorer (NASA).\n'
        '  * Halley\'s Comet reached perihelion on February 9th, 1986.\n' 
        '  * Halley reached its closest approach to Earth on April 11, 1986 at a distance of 0.42 AU or 62.4 million km.\n'  
        '  * Halley\'s Comet reached aphelion most recently on December 9, 2023.\n' 
        '  * It will reach perihelion next on July 28th, 2061 and then aphelion again on November 21st, 2097.\n'
        '* Halley\'s Meteor Showers: Each time Halley returns to the inner solar system, its nucleus sprays ice and rock into space. ' 
        'This debris stream results in two weak meteor showers each year: the Eta Aquarids in May and the Orionids in October.\n' 
        '* Physical Characteristics:\n' 
        '  * Halley\'s Comet is a relatively small object, with a nucleus measuring approximately 15 kilometers long, 8 kilometers ' 
        'wide, and 8 kilometers thick. Its shape has been likened to a peanut or a potato.\n' 
        '  * Its low density indicates that it is made of a large number of small pieces, held together very loosely, forming a ' 
        'structure known as a rubble pile.\n' 
        '  * The comet\'s nucleus is a dark, dusty conglomerate of ice and rock, often described as a "dirty snowball."\n' 
        '  * It reflects only 4% of the light that falls on it. This makes it one of the darkest objects in the solar system. This ' 
        'dark coloration is likely due to a layer of dust and complex organic molecules covering much of its surface.\n' 
        '* Tail or Coma: As Halley approaches the Sun, its volatile compounds, such as water, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, begin to ' 
        'sublimate, forming a coma, or atmosphere, around the nucleus. This coma can extend up to 100,000 kilometers across. The ' 
        'sublimation process also releases dust particles, which contribute to the comet\'s tail.\n' 
        '* Next Predicted Perihelion Passage: Halley\'s Comet is expected to reach its next perihelion, or closest approach to the ' 
        'Sun, on July 28, 2061. During this apparition, Earth will be in a more favorable position for viewing the comet compared to ' 
        'its 1986 appearance. It is predicted to be as bright as some of the brightest stars in the sky (apparent magnitude -0.3). ' 
        'Even more exciting, in 2134, Halley\'s Comet will pass very close to the earth (0.09 AU, or about 13 million km) and should ' 
        'be much brighter than in 2061 (apparent magnitude -2).',

        '  survey in Chile. It appears to be a dynamically new comet, meaning it\'s likely making its first close passage to the Sun.\n' 
        '* Orbital Characteristics: Perihelion (closest approach to the Sun): October 8, 2025, at a distance of approximately 0.33 AU, \n' 
        '  which is closer than Mercury\'s orbit. This close approach to the Sun is significant and could lead to substantial brightening.\n' 
        '* Closest approach to Earth: November 24, 2025, at a distance of about 0.40 AU.\n' 
        '* Eccentricity (e): The orbit is highly eccentric, 1.000251464554613 (July 11, 2025), indicating an unbound or nearly parabolic orbit.\n' 
        '* Inclination (i): The orbital plane is highly inclined, 147.864867556013 degrees.\n' 
        '* Visibility and Brightness: As of early July 2025, it\'s around magnitude 14-15, requiring a telescope for observation.\n' 
        '* Predicted Peak Brightness: It\'s expected to brighten significantly as it approaches perihelion. Predictions suggest it could \n' 
        '  reach a magnitude of around 5.2 to 8 in early October 2025.\n' 
        '* Naked-eye visibility: While magnitude 5.2 is generally considered within naked-eye visibility under very dark skies, it\'s \n' 
        '  more likely to be a binocular object for most observers, especially at its peak brightness.\n' 
        '* Observing Locations: Early October (near perihelion), observers in northern latitudes will see it best in the morning sky. \n' 
        '  Observers in southern latitudes can spot it in both the evening and morning skies.\n'
