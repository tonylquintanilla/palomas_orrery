    "What's an orrery? \n\n"

    "An orrery is a model of the solar system! This model attempts to display celestial and human objects in both stationary " 
    "and animated 3D plots over different periods of time. It uses real-time data from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Horizon System " 
    "to plot actual positions of objects. In addition, complete idealized orbits of the planets, asteroids, dwarf planets, and Kuiper " 
    "belt objects are calculated from their orbital parameters using Kepler's equations. Explore! \n\n" 

    "In addition to the solar system, you can also create 2D and 3D plots of our stellar neighborhood. There are four ways to do this: "
    "by distance in light-years or by brightness as apparent magnitude, and in both modes in a 2D or a 3D plot.\n\n"

    "You can plot our stellar neighborhood up to 100 light-years away in 2D and 3D, with a user defined entry in light-years.\n\n" 

    "The other way of selecting stars is by apparent magnitude. This method also plots 2D or 3D, but the star selection is quite " 
    "different. Instead of seeing all stars within a certain distance from the Sun, you see all stars visible to the unaided eye up " 
    "to a certain apparent, or visual magnitude, meaning how bright they appear, which is a function of how luminous they are and " 
    "their distance from us.\n\n" 
    
    "If you click the \"Move Camera to the Center\" button, the view will move to the position of the Sun.\n\n" 

    "The 3D plot is just that, you will "
    "see stars plotted relative to the Sun in their actual positions, up to the selected distance in light-years, or up to the selected "
    "apparent magnitude, regardless of the distance. In fact, you will begin to see the shape and tilt of the galaxy! You can also " 
    "use a drop down menu of bright stars and Messier Objects that are plotted, which will allow you to point to that object!\n\n"
    
    "You can also see in all plots the hovertext with the stars' information, in some cases in detail as I add it. You can toggle " 
    "between full hovertext information and just the star's name using the buttons, \"Full Star Info\" and \"Star Names Only\".\n\n"  
    
    "The 2D star plot is the classic Hertzprung-Russell diagram of stars plotted by "
    "luminosity, or absolute magnitude, meaning how intrinsically bright the star is, and temperature, which is related to the star's "
    "spectral class and color. This is a more scientific plot that reveals a lot about the "
    "kind of stars they are, and their place in stellar evolution. The 2D plots can be done both by distance and apparent magnitude.\n\n" 

    "More on the magnitude mode: You can select the magnitude "
    "you wish to plot up to apparent magnitude 9, extremely faint stars, which is what you might be able to see from space, down to -1.44, which is the "
    "apparent magnitude of the brightest star in the sky, Sirius, and everything in between as explained in the hovertext.\n\n" 

    "One nice feature of the 3D apparent magnitude plot, is that you can also plot Messier non-stellar objects, such as nebula and " 
    "open clusters! You can also see the stars in their "
    "familiar constellations IF viewed from the Sun's position at the center of the plot. For example, if you use the \"Move Camera to " 
    "Center\" button to move your view to the position of the Sun, and keep the default magnitude of 4 and select the manual scale default setting of "
    "1400 light-years distance, you will see the familiar Orion constellation with M42 the Orion Nebula! You can see other constellations " 
    "as well if you use the menu to select bright stars in a constellation. Hint: try the alpha stars! Experiment!\n\n"
    
    "A crucial difference between the magnitude plot and the distance plot is that some stars that are visible are extremely far away, " 
    "thousands of light-years, yet will still be "
    "visible because of how luminous they are, such as the Blue Supergiants! "
    "On the other hand, nearer, fainter stars, may not be plotted at all, for example White Dwarfs. In fact, the greater the apparent magnitude " 
    "that you select, you will fetch more faint stars, which are farther aways, and you will begin to see the shape and tilt of the " 
    "galaxy! Warning: the higher the apparent magnitude you select, the more stars you will fetch and the longer your plot will take " 
    "to create, up to a minute and a half at apparent magnitude 9, the limit of visibity in space, say from the Space Station.\n\n"

    "If the star 3D or 2D star field gets too crowded and you wish to see more detail, reduce the light-year distance, the apparent "
    "magnitude, or reduce the scale in light-years in the case of 3D apparent magnitude plots.\n\n" 
    
    "In the case of 3D plots, you can also toggle the hovertext from detailed descriptions " 
    "to star name only using the \"Star Names Only\" toggle button.\n\n" 

    "In 3D plots, to see the star field from the view point of the Sun (us!) use the \"Move Camera to Center\" button.\n\n"
    
    "The color scales follow the color of the black body radiation associated with star temperature, in other words, the star\'s " 
    "actual color. The Sun is colored chlorophyll green, to set it apart in the plot and because it represents the Sun\'s life-giving light! " 
    "Plants have evolved to use the most abundant parts of the Sun's visible light spectrum for photosynthesis (red and blue) " 
    "while reflecting the green light.\n\n"

    "Solar System Objects:\nThe Solar sytem object selection menu is scrollable. Select the objects to plot.\n\n"  

    "Data availability is limited for space missions and comets. "
    "Objects will only be plotted on dates the data is available. "
    "For space missions and comets, be careful to enter a start date and number of days, weeks, months or years to plot that are " 
    "within the timeframes of all the objects to plot to avoid plotting errors. "
    "For dates beyond 2199-12-29, the Horizons system does not provide data for most objects. " 
    "Objects like Dwarf Planet Sedna have orbital periods that are thousands of years long so the orbit will only plot partially " 
    "with actual positions. Full ideal orbits estimated from their orbital parameters using Kepler\'s equations are also plotted. " 
    "This is also the case for Dwarf Planet Pluto!\n\n"

    "The Sun is visualized in detail with all its structural sections, core, radiative zone, convective zone and photosphere, "
    "chromosphere, inner corona, outer corona, and solar wind (inner limit, termination shock and heliopause). See the hovertext.\n\n" 
    
    "We also visualize the inner and outer Oort clouds, the inferred source of comets. Manually select the scale "
    "at 100000 AU to see this."

    "This orrery is created using data from the JPL Horizons system (https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html#/) "
    "See the hyperlink on the orrery display. "
    "Ensure you have an active internet connection, as data is fetched in real-time. Be patient when fetching a lot of object positions, " 
    "especially non-animated plots that show actual positions. \n\n"

    "J2000 Ecliptic Coordinate System:\n" 
    "Object positions are fetched from the JPL Horizons system, which by default provides data in the J2000 ecliptic coordinate system. "
    "This is a celestial coordinate system that aligns with the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun (the ecliptic) and is fixed " 
    "relative to the stars as of the epoch J2000.0 (January 1, 2000).\n\n"

    "Astronomical Units (AU):\n" 
    "The x, y, and z coordinates are measured in Astronomical Units (AU). "
    "One AU is approximately the average distance from the Earth to the Sun, about 149.6 million kilometers or 93 million miles.\n\n"

        'top or a lumpy potato.\n' 
        '* Rotation: Bennu rotates fairly quickly, completing a rotation every 4.3 hours.\n' 
        '* Orbit: Bennu\'s orbit brings it relatively close to Earth, making it accessible for a spacecraft mission. However, its orbit also crosses Earth\'s.\n' 
        '* Scientific Value: Carbonaceous asteroids like Bennu are believed to contain the building blocks of life - organic molecules, '

        'system and the origins of life itself. Bennu is a pristine sample of this material.\n' 
        '* Accessibility: Bennu\'s near-Earth orbit made it a logistically feasible target for the OSIRIS-REx mission. The round trip was '

        '* Sample Return: The primary goal of OSIRIS-REx was to collect a sample of material from Bennu and return it to Earth. Bennu\'s ' 
        'size, composition, and relatively slow rotation made it a good candidate for a touch-and-go sample collection maneuver.\n' 
        'Planetary Defense: Studying Bennu also provides valuable information for planetary defense. Because it\'s a near-Earth asteroid, '

        '* Spacecraft in Good Condition: After completing its primary mission, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft was still in good working ' 
        'order and had plenty of fuel left.\n' 
        '* Extended Mission: Instead of retiring the spacecraft, NASA decided to extend the mission and send it to another asteroid, '

        '* Repurposed Spacecraft: OSIRIS-APEX is essentially the same OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, but with a new target and new objectives.\n' 
        '* Connection to OSIRIS-REx: The most direct connection is that OSIRIS-APEX uses the exact same spacecraft that successfully ' 
        'explored Bennu. This means it inherits all the capabilities and instruments that were used on the OSIRIS-REx mission.\n' 
        '* Building on Knowledge: The knowledge and experience gained from the OSIRIS-REx mission are invaluable for OSIRIS-APEX. ' 
        'Scientists and engineers can apply what they learned about asteroid navigation, sample collection, and data analysis to the '

        'approach to Earth in 2029. This close approach will allow scientists to observe how Earth\'s gravity affects the asteroid.\n' 
        '* Different Asteroid Type: Apophis is a different type of asteroid than Bennu. It\'s a "stony" asteroid rather than a ' 
        'carbonaceous one. This gives scientists an opportunity to compare and contrast different types of asteroids.\n' 
        '* Surface Changes: OSIRIS-APEX will observe Apophis before and after its close encounter with Earth to see how the encounter '

        'traditional flyby missions. The spacecraft will actually enter a close orbit around Apophis and study it for an extended ' 
        'period.\n' 
        '  * Close Approach: Before entering orbit, OSIRIS-APEX will perform a close flyby of Apophis. This will allow the spacecraft '

        'plan the subsequent orbital phase of the mission. The close flyby is expected to happen shortly after Apophis makes its close ' 
        'approach to Earth in April 2029.\n' 
        '  * Purpose of the Flyby: The primary purpose of the flyby is to gather preliminary data about Apophis. This will help ' 
        'scientists select the best location for the spacecraft to enter orbit and conduct more detailed studies. By observing Apophis ' 
        'before and after its close approach to Earth, OSIRIS-APEX can study how the asteroid\'s surface and rotation are affected by ' 
        'Earth\'s gravity. This is a rare opportunity to observe such a phenomenon up close.\n'

        '* Challenges: Mercury experiences scorching temperatures of over 400Â°C (750Â°F). The spacecraft needs special '

        '* Timeline:\n ' 
        '  * According to this model, the closest flyby of Mercury by BepiColombo occurred on January 8th, 2025, 6 UTC. ' 
        'During this flyby, the spacecraft came within approximately 0.00001829 AU from Mercury\'s surface: 0.00001829 AU = 2,736 km ' 
        '(from Mercury\'s center), Mercury radius = 2,440 km, actual flyby altitude â 296 km above Mercury\'s surface!\n ' 
        '  * This is the statement from ESA, \"On 8 January 2025, the ESA/JAXA BepiColombo mission will fly just 295 km above ' 
        'Mercury\'s surface, with a closest approach scheduled for 06:59 CET (05:59 UTC). It will use this opportunity to ' 
        'photograph Mercury, make unique measurements of the planet\'s environment, and fine-tune science instrument operations ' 
        'before the main mission begins. This sixth and final flyby will reduce the spacecraft\'s speed and change its direction, ' 
        'readying it for entering orbit around the tiny planet in late 2026.\"\n ' 
        '  * December 2025 - November 2026: After the flyby, BepiColombo will still be in a trajectory that takes it around ' 
        'the Sun, but it will be heavily influenced by Mercury\'s gravity. It will essentially be "captured" by Mercury, ' 
        'but not yet in a stable orbit.\n ' 
        '  * November 2026: Finally, after a series of maneuvers, BepiColombo will achieve a stable orbit around Mercury. ' 
        'The two orbiters (MPO and Mio) will then separate and begin their individual science missions.\n ' 
        '  * The BepiColombo mission has a planned duration of one Earth year of scientific observations at Mercury. This ' 
        'nominal mission is set to begin in April 2027, after the orbiters have settled into their final orbits and ' 
        'completed their commissioning phase.\n ' 
        '  * If the spacecraft remain in good health and there\'s continued scientific interest, the mission could be ' 
        'prolonged for another one to two years. This would allow scientists to gather even more data and further deepen ' 
        'our understanding of Mercury.\n '

# Comets        
        'Ikeya-Seki': 'Comet Ikeya-Seki, formally designated C/1965 S1, was a stunning sungrazing comet that put on quite a show ' 
        'in 1965! It was one of the brightest comets of the 20th century and is a member of the Kreutz sungrazers, a family of ' 
        'comets believed to have originated from a larger comet that broke apart long ago. As a Kreutz sungrazer, it provided valuable ' 
        'information about these comets and their origins.\n  Key dates and information:\n ' 
        '* September 18, 1965: Kaoru Ikeya and Tsutomu Seki, two amateur astronomers in Japan, independently discovered the comet. ' 
        'It was initially a faint telescopic object.\n * October 21, 1965: Ikeya-Seki reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun.' 
        'It passed incredibly close, a mere 450,000 km (280,000 mi) above the Sun\'s surface! This made it briefly visible in daylight. ' 
        'The intense heat caused the comet\'s nucleus to fragment into at least three pieces. The breakup of its nucleus offered ' 
        'scientists a rare opportunity to study the composition and behavior of comets.\n * Late October - November 1965: ' 
        'After perihelion, Ikeya-Seki developed a spectacularly long tail, stretching across the sky for millions of miles. ' 
        'It was a breathtaking sight for observers.\n * Post-1965: The comet faded from view as it moved away from the Sun. ' 
        'Though it\'s still out there, with an orbital period estimated to be roughly 880 years, we won\'t see it again for a ' 
        'very long time.',
        
        'West': 'Notable comet for its bright and impressive tail.',
        
        'Halley': 'Most famous comet, returns every 76 years. ' 
        '* Orbital Period and Characteristics: Halley\'s Comet has an average orbital period of 76 Earth years. However, this period ' 
        'can vary due to the gravitational influence of planets, particularly Jupiter and Saturn.  In fact, the gravitational pull ' 
        'of the major planets alters the orbital period from revolution to revolution. Measured from one perihelion passage to the ' 
        'next, Halley\'s period has been as short as 74.42 years (1835-1910) and as long as 79.25 years (451-530).\n' 
        '* Orbit Path: The comet\'s orbit is highly elliptical, with an eccentricity of ' 
        '0.967. This means its path around the Sun takes it from a point relatively close to the Sun (perihelion) to a point far ' 
        'beyond Neptune\'s orbit (aphelion).\n' 
        '* Orbit is Retrograde: Halley\'s Comet orbits the Sun in a retrograde direction, opposite to the direction of most planets. ' 
        'Its orbit is also inclined by 18 degrees to the ecliptic, the plane of Earth\'s orbit.\n' 
        '* History of Observations: Halley\'s Comet has been observed and recorded by astronomers for millennia. Before Halley\'s ' 
        'prediction of its return in 1705, these appearances were not recognized as being the same object. Ancient civilizations, ' 
        'particularly the Chinese, meticulously documented cometary appearances, providing valuable historical records.  It is a ' 
        'remarkable fact that observations made with the naked eye 2,000 years ago are still of value today. In the centuries ' 
        'leading up to Halley\'s prediction, observations from China, Babylon, and Europe helped to track the comet\'s appearances. ' 
        'These observations, even those made with the naked eye, have proven valuable for modern astronomers studying the comet\'s ' 
        'long-term behavior.\n' 
        '  * The comet\'s appearance in 1066, shortly before the Norman Conquest of England, is perhaps its most famous historical ' 
        'sighting. It was depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry, a significant historical artifact. It is said that William the Conqueror ' 
        'believed the comet heralded his success.\n' 
        '  * The 1910 apparition of Halley\'s Comet was also notable, as it was the first time the comet was captured on camera.\n' 
        '  * The 1986 apparition marked a turning point in our understanding of comets. For the first time, spacecraft were sent ' 
        'to encounter a comet, providing close-up images and data about its nucleus and composition. Halley\'s Comet reached perihelion on February 9th, 1986.\n'  
        '  * Halley\'s Comet reached aphelion most recently on December 9th, 2023.\n' 
        '  * It will reach perihelion next on July 28th, 2061 and then aphelion again on November 21st, 2097.\n'
        '* Halley\'s Meteor Showers: Each time Halley returns to the inner solar system, its nucleus sprays ice and rock into space. ' 
        'This debris stream results in two weak meteor showers each year: the Eta Aquarids in May and the Orionids in October.\n' 
        '* Physical Characteristics:\n' 
        '  * Halley\'s Comet is a relatively small object, with a nucleus measuring approximately 15 kilometers long, 8 kilometers ' 
        'wide, and 8 kilometers thick. Its shape has been likened to a peanut or a potato.\n' 
        '  * Its low density indicates that it is made of a large number of small pieces, held together very loosely, forming a ' 
        'structure known as a rubble pile.\n' 
        '  * The comet\'s nucleus is a dark, dusty conglomerate of ice and rock, often described as a "dirty snowball."\n' 
        '  * It reflects only 4% of the light that falls on it. This makes it one of the darkest objects in the solar system. This ' 
        'dark coloration is likely due to a layer of dust and complex organic molecules covering much of its surface.\n' 
        '* Tail or Coma: As Halley approaches the Sun, its volatile compounds, such as water, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, begin to ' 
        'sublimate, forming a coma, or atmosphere, around the nucleus. This coma can extend up to 100,000 kilometers across. The ' 
        'sublimation process also releases dust particles, which contribute to the comet\'s tail.\n' 
        '* Next Predicted Perihelion Passage: Halley\'s Comet is expected to reach its next perihelion, or closest approach to the ' 
        'Sun, on July 28, 2061. During this apparition, Earth will be in a more favorable position for viewing the comet compared to ' 
        'its 1986 appearance. It is predicted to be as bright as some of the brightest stars in the sky (apparent magnitude -0.3). ' 
        'Even more exciting, in 2134, Halley\'s Comet will pass very close to the earth (0.09 AU, or about 13 million km) and should ' 
        'be much brighter than in 2061 (apparent magnitude -2).',
