    Creates a visual indicator showing the direction to the Sun (along negative X-axis).
    Scale automatically adjusts based on the plot's axis range or provided shell radius.

        shell_radius (float): Radius of the shell being displayed, to scale indicator appropriately
        object_type (str): Type of object being visualized ('Sun' or a planet name)
        center_object (str): Name of the object at the center of the plot
