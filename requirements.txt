# Paloma's Orrery - Requirements
# Updated: February 28, 2026
#
# PYTHON VERSION COMPATIBILITY
# ============================
# Recommended: Python 3.13.x (tested, stable, all dependencies compatible)
# Supported:   Python 3.11 - 3.13
# WARNING:     Python 3.14 (released Oct 2025) has known compatibility
#              issues with several dependencies. See notes below.
#
# PYTHON 3.14 KNOWN ISSUES:
# - kaleido 0.2.1: NOT compatible with Python 3.14. Kaleido v1.0+
#   requires Plotly 6.1.1+ and Chrome installed separately.
#   The bundled Chromium approach (v0.2.1) does not build on 3.14.
# - customtkinter 5.2.2: Last release was 2+ years ago (inactive
#   project). Uses deprecated distutils patterns. May break on 3.14
#   which removes more legacy imports. Test before upgrading Python.
# - plotly: PyPI lists support through 3.13 only. Plotly 6.x works
#   on 3.14 but requires kaleido v1.0+ for image export (breaking
#   change from v0.2.1 API).
# - astropy 7.2: Has begun adding Python 3.14 support (CLI fixes,
#   wheel builds in progress). Full 3.14 wheels may require astropy 8.x.
#   The cp314 wheel tracking issue is github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/18187
# - numpy 2.3+: Supports Python 3.14
# - scipy 1.15+: Supports Python 3.14
#
# RECOMMENDATION: Stay on Python 3.13 until kaleido, customtkinter,
# and astropy all have confirmed 3.14 support. Monitor:
#   - github.com/plotly/Kaleido/issues/343 (kaleido 3.14)
#   - github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/18187 (astropy 3.14 wheels)
#   - github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter (dormant since 5.2.2)

kaleido==0.2.1        # Static Plotly image export (PINNED - v1.0 breaks API, needs Chrome)
                      # NOTE: If upgrading to Plotly 6.x, must also upgrade to kaleido>=1.0.0
                      # and install Chrome. See: pypi.org/project/kaleido/
pillow>=10.0.0        # Image processing

# Geospatial and Earth System
simplekml>=1.3.6      # KML generation for Google Earth biosphere visualizations

# GUI and interface
# Note: tkinter is included with Python standard library
customtkinter>=5.2.0  # Modern themed widgets for tkinter
                      # WARNING: Project appears inactive (no release since 5.2.2, Feb 2024)
                      # Monitor for Python 3.14 breakage with deprecated distutils

# Interactive shell
ipython>=8.0.0        # Enhanced interactive Python shell

# Date and time handling

openpyxl>=3.1.0       # Excel file parsing for NSIDC ice data (V4 format)

# ============================
# NOTES ON PLOTLY/KALEIDO UPGRADE PATH
# ============================
# Current: Plotly 5.x + kaleido 0.2.1 (bundled Chromium, simple API)
# Future:  Plotly 6.x + kaleido 1.0+ (requires Chrome install, new API)
#
# The kaleido 1.0 migration changes:
#   OLD: fig.write_image("fig.png")  # kaleido 0.2.1, just works
#   NEW: fig.write_image("fig.png")  # kaleido 1.0+, needs Chrome on system
#
# Paloma's Orrery uses write_image() in social_media_export.py and
# earth_system_generator.py for KML legend PNGs. The web gallery
# pipeline (json_converter -> index.html) does NOT use kaleido at all.
# Gallery runs entirely in-browser via Plotly.js CDN.
#
# Upgrade when: Python 3.14 is required, or Plotly 5.x reaches EOL.
# Test with: pip install plotly>=6.1.1 kaleido>=1.0.0
#            Then run: plotly_get_chrome (installs Chromium for kaleido)
