    Uranus Ring System Transformation:

    For proper alignment with satellite orbits, Uranus's ring system requires a specific 
    compound rotation approach due to the planet's extreme axial tilt (97.77°).

    The transformation uses these key elements:
    1. A 105° rotation around the X-axis followed by a 105° rotation around the Y-axis
    (empirically determined to match satellite orbit alignment)
    2. Converting point coordinates to NumPy arrays before rotation
    3. Applying center position offset to the final coordinates after both rotations

    This approach ensures that all components of the Uranian system (rings, satellites, 
    radiation belts) share the same reference frame, correctly representing the planet's
    unique orientation in space.

    NOTE: The 105° value, rather than the nominal 97.77° axial tilt, accounts for the 
    specific reference frame conversion between Uranus's equatorial plane and the
    ecliptic coordinate system used for visualization.
