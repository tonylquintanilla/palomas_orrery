# Mission Control Module Documentation

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

The `mission_control` module serves as the primary interface for users to interact with the Paloma's Orrery Earth System Visualization. It allows users to select predefined heatwave scenarios, generate corresponding Google Earth KML layers, and then launch these layers for visualization in Google Earth Pro. This module is crucial for demonstrating the impact of various heat events across different historical and projected timelines.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The `mission_control` module is composed of two main components:
- `MissionControlApp`: A Tkinter application responsible for launching generated KML/KMZ files.
- `MissionSelector`: A Tkinter application that allows users to select a heatwave scenario and triggers the generation of KML layers (spikes, heatmap, and population impact).

The interaction flow is as follows:
1. The user first interacts with the `MissionSelector` to choose a scenario.
2. Upon selection, `MissionSelector` processes the data and generates KML files.
3. The user then uses the `MissionControlApp` to add and launch these generated KML files in Google Earth Pro.

## 3. High-Level Functionality

### 3.1. `MissionControlApp` (`earth_system_controller.py`)

The `MissionControlApp` provides a simple graphical user interface for managing and launching KML/KMZ files. Its core functionalities include:
- **Adding KML Layers**: Users can browse and add multiple KML or KMZ files to a list.
- **Clearing the List**: Removes all loaded files from the display list.
- **Launching Selected Layers**: Opens the selected KML/KMZ files in Google Earth Pro (or the default KML viewer for the operating system).

This application acts as a viewer and launcher for the outputs generated by the `MissionSelector`.

### 3.2. `MissionSelector` (`earth_system_generator.py`)

The `MissionSelector` is a more complex component responsible for the core logic of scenario selection and KML generation. Its detailed functionality is described in [earth_system_generator.md](earth_system_generator.md).
