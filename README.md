## Introduction
Paloma’s Orrery is an advanced astronomical visualization tool that turns real NASA/ESA data into interactive 3D and 2D visualizations of the solar system and nearby stars. You can explore planets and moons, view spacecraft trajectories, see planetary interiors, and map the stars in your neighborhood.

Created by civil & environmental engineer Tony Quintanilla, it blends scientific accuracy with visual beauty, making astronomy accessible to students, educators, and space enthusiasts.

## Quick Start (Beginners)

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 
   (Note: This program is tested only on Windows. A previous attempt to adapt it for macOS was only partially successful because the threading model works well on Windows but would need refactoring for macOS’s event-loop behavior. Advanced users are welcome to explore this further.)  
- Python 3.8+ (tested with Python 3.13)  
- Internet connection  
- ~300MB free disk space (for cache & data files)  

### 1. Install Python
Download Python from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and during installation check “Add Python to PATH.” To confirm the installation, open a Command Prompt and type `python --version` — you should see something like `Python 3.13.0`.  

### 2. Download the Orrery
Go to [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tonylquintanilla/palomas_orrery), click the green “Code” button, choose “Download ZIP,” and extract it to a folder of your choice.  

### 3. Install Required Libraries
You can install everything at once by opening a Command Prompt, navigating to the extracted folder, and typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  

Or open a Command Prompt and install step-by-step (recommended for beginners so you know what’s being added):  
1. Install the core math libraries by typing `pip install numpy pandas scipy` and pressing Enter.  
2. Install the astronomy libraries with `pip install astropy astroquery erfa`.  
3. Install the visualization libraries using `pip install plotly kaleido pillow`.  
4. Install the GUI library by typing `pip install customtkinter`.  
5. Install web and data utilities using `pip install requests beautifulsoup4 html5lib python-dateutil pytz`.  

### 4. Run the Program
You can run it three ways:  
- Double-click `palomas_orrery.py` in File Explorer.  
- Open a Command Prompt, navigate to the folder, and type `python palomas_orrery.py`.  
- In VS Code, open the project folder, open `palomas_orrery.py`, and press F5.  

---

## First Run Tips
- Start with a small selection of planets or moons.  
- The first time you plot an object, the program will ask to fetch data from JPL Horizons — choose “Yes” to build your cache.  
- On later runs, you can use the cached data for faster plotting.  
- Hover over objects in the plot for extra information.  

---

## Key Features (Beginner-Friendly)
- Interactive solar system visualizations — select planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and spacecraft.  
- Planetary interiors — view cores, mantles, atmospheres, magnetospheres, and more.  
- Spacecraft tracking — follow historic and current missions in 3D.  
- Star maps — generate Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams and 3D local space maps.  
- Comets & asteroids — plot accurate orbits from JPL Horizons.  
- Lagrange points — visualize gravitational balance points in Earth–Moon and Sun–Earth systems.  
- Animations — watch objects move over timescales from minutes to years.

## Basic Usage Examples

**Plot Planets**  
Select one or more planets from the GUI’s object list and click “Plot Entered Date.”  

**View Planetary Shells**  
Set a planet as the center object, select the layers you want (core, mantle, atmosphere, etc.), then plot and rotate in 3D.  

**Track a Mission**  
Select a spacecraft, set its date range, and plot to see its trajectory.  

**Explore Stars**  
In the main GUI, click “2D and 3D Star Visualizations” and choose a distance or brightness filter.

## Architecture Overview

Paloma’s Orrery is modular by design, with separate Python files for each major functional area.  
The architecture is divided into **Core**, **Visualization**, **Data Fetching**, **Utility**, and **GUI** layers.

1. **Core Modules** — Handle main logic, initialization, and object plotting.  
2. **Visualization Modules** — Create plots, animations, and visual representations of planetary shells, orbits, and stars.  
3. **Data Fetching Modules** — Retrieve astronomical data from JPL Horizons, SIMBAD, Gaia, and other databases.  
4. **Utility Modules** — Handle caching, configuration, math utilities, and shared functions.  
5. **GUI Modules** — Manage the user interface and event handling.

This separation allows easier maintenance, testing, and feature expansion.
