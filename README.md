### Step 4: Run the Application

Navigate to the project folder in your File Explorer and double-click the **`palomas_orrery.py`** file. The application will start, and you can begin exploring\!

For the best experience, you can also run the program from an editor like **VS Code**, which allows you to see all console output and error messages directly.

**Explore solar visualizations**:
   - Select one or more planets from the object checkbutton list, "Select Solar Shells, Planets, Dwarf Planets, Moons..."
   - Click, "Plot Entered Date"; the program will generate the visualization
   - If this is the first time you are plotting an object or dates an interactive window will open to confirm the data fetch from Horizons
      - "New orbit data is needed for __ selected objects" 
      - "Would you like to fetch updated data from JPL Horizons?"
      - Select: "Remember my choice for this session" 
      - Click, "Yes - Update Cache" or "No - Use Existing" to add fetched data to the cache. If this is your first time, click "Yes". 
      - Creating a JSON cache file save time plotting versus fetching fresh data every time. 
   - If you want to save the image as a PNG file, click "Yes", and save the file at a location of your choice
   - If you click "No" you will be given the option to save the image as a fully functional HTML file, a much larger file size.
   - View the visualization in HTML format in your default browser. Explore this visualization and the Plotly graphic functionality.
   - There are many kinds of objects. Explore the functionality of the GUI. Read the hovertext for guidance and information.
   - If you have any comments or questions, feel free to reach out to me at tonyquintanilla@gmail.com

**For stellar visualizations** 
   - In palomas_orrery.py, the main GUI, click on the blue button at the bottom, "2D and 3D Star Visualizations"
   - (optional - run `star_visualization_gui.py`):

   *Note: The stellar visualization system creates its own data files when first used:*
   - **VOT files** (`hipparcos_data.vot`, `gaia_data.vot`): Downloaded astronomical data in VOTable format
   - **PKL files** (`star_properties_distance.pkl`, `star_properties_magnitude.pkl`): Processed star data for quick searching
   
   *These files are automatically created when you first run stellar visualizations and query the Hipparcos/Gaia databases. The GitHub repository does not include these files as they are generated based on your specific search parameters and preferences. These files can become quite large.*

**Verify your orbit cache** (optional - only after you've used the software):
   - run verify_orbit_cache.py

   *Note: The GitHub repository does not include a pre-built cache file. The orbit cache (`orbit_paths.json`) is created automatically as you use the software and fetch data for different solar system objects. This verification step is only useful after you've run the main application and built up some cached data.*

**Initial Setup Tips:**
- Start with a few objects to build your initial JSON cache. The file size will increase as you plot more objects and dates. 
- Use "Fetch Special" mode for experiments
- The software automatically creates backups and maintains cache health

### Using the Enhanced Features

**Planetary Shell Visualization:**
1. Set any planet as the center object
2. Enable shell components (core, mantle, atmosphere, etc.)
3. Observe scientifically accurate internal structure
4. Use different center objects to explore various planetary types

**Mission Tracking:**
1. Select spacecraft from the comprehensive mission list
2. Set appropriate date ranges for mission phases
3. Watch historic missions like Voyager's grand tour
4. Track current missions in real-time

**Lagrange Point Exploration:**
1. Enable Lagrange point visualization
2. Understand gravitational balance points
3. See why L2 is preferred for space telescopes
4. Explore both Earth-Moon and Sun-Earth systems

**Time Controls:**
- Date selector for any moment from January 1, 1900- December 31, 2199 CE (JPL Horizons limits)
- Default to "now" or modify the current date and the default 28 "Days to Plot" (note: the first date is the current date)
   - Or enter the end date you want
- Animation controls: enter the number of frames to animate in minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or years
- Click "Plot Entered Date" for a static plot
- Click one of the animation buttons, then "Play" in the Plotly HTML plot

**Apsidal Markers:**
- Plot any object with an orbit (planets, asteroids, comets)
- Look for the square markers indicating perihelion/apohelion
- Hover over markers to see the calculated dates
- Note how dates change based on where the object currently is in its orbit
- Observe special handling for hyperbolic objects that may show "Past perihelion"

### Performance Tips

1. **First Run**: 
   - Start with a small selection of objects
   - The cache builds incrementally as you use the software

2. **Optimal Usage**:
   - Use "Fetch Special" for experiments
   - Select only objects you need to plot
   - Use coarser intervals for long time spans

3. **Cache Maintenance**:
   - **Cache is precious data** - treats cached orbit data as a valuable astronomical archive
   - Cache grows as you use the software and serves as backup if JPL Horizons become unavailable or limited
   - **Manual cleanup option**: If your cache gets too large, you can clean data older than 90 days by running Python and calling `from orbit_data_manager import prune_old_data; prune_old_data()` (Developer note: This feature exists but creator avoids using it to preserve data)
   - Run `verify_orbit_cache.py` if you suspect issues, but only repairs corruption (doesn't delete good data)
   - Multiple automatic backups created to protect against data loss

## üîß Configuration & Customization

### Interval Settings

# In palomas_orrery.py - Adjustable default intervals for fetching data

    'Orbital objects': '1d' for closed elliptical orbits like planets, asteroids, trans-neptunian objects, many comets         
    'Trajectory objects': '6h' for open trajectories like space missions, or hyperbolic orbits like some comets or interstellar objects  
    'Satellite objects': '1h' for moon, with typically short elliptical orbital periods   

- The user can change these setting in the GUI. If you modify the settings, click "Use updated intervals below to fetch data (will not be cached)" to use them.            

### Planetary Shell Configuration

# Each planet has configurable shell variables, that illustrate the inner and outer structure, for example for Mercury:
- Select the planet and the shells you wish to plot; see the hovertext for explanations. Note this feature only works in static plots. 

    'Inner Core' 
    'Outer_core'
    'Mantle'
    'Crust'
    'Atmosphere'
    'Magnetosphere' 
    'Hill Sphere'

   otherwise it is the selected central object, planets, the Moon, and certain other locations of space missions

## üåü Future Development

- As interesting objects come up, for example the new interstellar object 3I/ATLAS (2025), I may implement them using JPL Horizons ephemeris, or new functionality is developed to enhance visualizations. Suggestions are welcome, tonyquintanilla@gmail.com

## üé≠ The Human Touch

While built on rigorous astronomical data and sophisticated algorithms, Paloma's Orrery never loses sight of the human element in space exploration. Every spacecraft has a story, every star has unique characteristics, and every celestial dance unfolds according to the same physical laws that govern our daily lives.

The new planetary shell system allows users to explore the hidden interiors of worlds both familiar and exotic. From Mercury's surprisingly large core to Jupiter's complex atmospheric layers, each visualization tells the story of planetary formation and evolution.

Whether you're tracking Voyager's historic journey to the edge of the solar system or exploring the internal structure of distant worlds, Paloma's Orrery makes the cosmos accessible, beautiful, and endlessly fascinating.
