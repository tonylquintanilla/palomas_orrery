## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Technical Innovation

**Data Integration**: The software seamlessly integrates data from multiple authoritative sources:
- **NASA JPL Horizons**: Real-time solar system ephemeris data
- **ESA Hipparcos**: High-precision positions for bright stars (118,218 stars)
- **ESA Gaia DR3**: Revolutionary stellar census data for 1.8 billion stars
- **SIMBAD Database**: Comprehensive stellar properties and classifications
- **Messier Catalog**: Deep-sky objects including nebulae, star clusters, and galaxies

**Smart Processing Pipeline**: Raw astronomical data undergoes sophisticated processing through specialized modules. The solar system pipeline handles orbit caching with selective updates and Planet 9 synthesis, while the stellar pipeline manages coordinate transformations, spectral classification, and multi-catalog cross-matching.

### Advanced Oort Cloud Modeling
The enhanced Oort Cloud visualization represents a significant advancement in astronomical software, incorporating:
- **Formation Physics**: The visualization reflects actual formation mechanisms - planetesimal scattering by giant planets, galactic tidal sculpting, and ongoing modification by stellar encounters
- **Observational Constraints**: Recent discoveries of inner Oort Cloud objects like Sedna provide direct evidence for the complex structure
- **Computational Validation**: Models incorporate results from N-body simulations showing how the original spherical population has been sculpted into the structured system observed today

## üé≠ The Human Touch

While built on rigorous astronomical data and sophisticated algorithms, Paloma's Orrery never loses sight of the human element in space exploration. Every spacecraft has a story, every star has unique characteristics, and every celestial dance unfolds according to the same physical laws that govern our daily lives.

The recent GUI improvements exemplify this philosophy - instead of forcing users through repetitive dialogs, the software now remembers preferences and provides clear, color-coded feedback. The cache system protects valuable data while allowing experimentation, and the testing infrastructure ensures reliability.
