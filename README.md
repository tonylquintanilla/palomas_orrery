**üåü Why Python is Free:**
Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 with the philosophy of making programming accessible to everyone. The Python Software Foundation (PSF) maintains this commitment to keeping Python free and open source.
This is one of the reasons Python has become so popular in scientific computing, data science, and astronomy - researchers and institutions can use it without budget constraints or licensing concerns.
Bottom line: You can download, install, and use Python completely free for Paloma's Orrery or any other project!

1. Visit the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download Python 3.9 or newer (recommended: Python 3.11 or 3.12 for best compatibility)
3. **Important**: During installation, check "Add Python to PATH" option
4. Choose "Install for all users" if you have administrator privileges

**Verify Installation:**
1. Open Command Prompt (Windows Key + R, type `cmd`, press Enter)
2. Type `python --version` and press Enter
3. You should see something like `Python 3.12.x`
4. Type `pip --version` to verify pip is installed

**Alternative Installation Methods (not tested):**
- **Microsoft Store**: Search for "Python" in Microsoft Store for an easy installation
- **Anaconda**: Download from [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/) for a complete data science environment

### Step 2: Set Up Your Python Environment

**Option A: Direct Installation (This is how the entire project is developed and extensively tested)**

```bash
# Core scientific computing libraries
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib plotly

# Astronomical libraries
pip install astropy astroquery jplephem skyfield

# Data handling and utilities
pip install pandas pillow kaleido tenacity
```

**What these libraries do:**

**Scientific Computing Foundation:**
- **numpy**: Fast numerical arrays and mathematical operations (the foundation for everything else)
- **scipy**: Advanced scientific computing (optimization, interpolation, signal processing)
- **matplotlib**: 2D plotting and basic visualization
- **plotly**: Interactive 3D visualizations and web-based plots (HTML files)

**Astronomical Powerhouses:**
- **astropy**: Core astronomy library (coordinates, time systems, units, file formats)
- **astroquery**: Query astronomical databases (NASA JPL Horizons, SIMBAD, Gaia)
- **jplephem**: NASA JPL planetary ephemeris data (precise planetary positions)
- **skyfield**: High-precision astronomy computations (satellite tracking, coordinate transforms)

**Data & Utility Support:**
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis (handling CSV files, time series)
- **pillow**: Image processing (loading, saving, manipulating images)
- **kaleido**: Static image export for Plotly (PNG, SVG, PDF generation)
- **tenacity**: Retry logic for network operations (handles temporary download failures)

**Additional useful libraries:**
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```
- **requests**: HTTP library for web requests (downloading data from online sources)
- **beautifulsoup4**: HTML/XML parsing (extracting data from web pages)

**GUI framework (usually pre-installed):**
```bash
# tkinter usually comes with Python, but if needed:
# On most systems, tkinter is included with Python
# If you get import errors, try:
pip install tk
```
- **tkinter**: Python's standard GUI toolkit (creates windows, buttons, menus for the interface)

**Why this approach works well:**
- ‚úÖ Zero configuration overhead
- ‚úÖ No environment activation/deactivation steps
- ‚úÖ Extensively tested with this exact setup
- ‚úÖ Perfect if this is your primary astronomical software
- ‚úÖ Follows the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" philosophy

**Option B: Virtual Environment (For Multi-Project Users -- not tested!)**

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd path\to\palomas_orrery

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv orrery_env

# Activate the virtual environment
orrery_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (same as Option A)
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib plotly astropy astroquery jplephem skyfield pandas pillow kaleido tenacity
```

**When you might need virtual environments:**
- Working on multiple Python projects simultaneously
- Different projects require different versions of the same library
- You want to experiment without affecting your main setup
- You're contributing to open source projects with specific requirements

**Option C: Using Conda (If you have Anaconda installed -- not tested!)**
```bash
# Create a new conda environment
conda create -n orrery_env python=3.11
conda activate orrery_env

pip install numpy scipy matplotlib plotly astropy astroquery jplephem skyfield pandas pillow kaleido tenacity
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
# Test that key libraries import correctly
python -c "import numpy, matplotlib, astropy, plotly; print('All libraries installed successfully!')"
```

### Step 4: Troubleshooting Common Windows Issues (see above note about use of AI assistants; these tips are not tested!)

**If you get "python is not recognized":**
1. Reinstall Python and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked
2. Manually add Python to PATH:
   - Search for "Environment Variables" in Windows
   - Add `C:\Python3X\` and `C:\Python3X\Scripts\` to your PATH
   - Restart Command Prompt

**If pip installs fail:**
```bash
# Upgrade pip first
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Step 5: Alternative Setup with requirements.txt (not tested!)

Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory:
```txt

   - There are many kinds of objects. Explore the functionality of the GUI. Read the hovertext for guidance and information.
   - If you have any comments or questions, feel free to reach out to me at tonyquintanilla@gmail.com

4. **For stellar visualizations** 
   - In palomas_orrery.py, the main GUI, click on the blue button at the bottom, "2D and 3D Star Visualizations"
   - (optional - run `star_visualization_gui.py`):

   *Note: The stellar visualization system creates its own data files when first used:*
   - **VOT files** (`hipparcos_data.vot`, `gaia_data.vot`): Downloaded astronomical data in VOTable format
   - **PKL files** (`star_properties_distance.pkl`, `star_properties_magnitude.pkl`): Processed star data for quick searching
   
   *These files are automatically created when you first run stellar visualizations and query the Hipparcos/Gaia databases. The GitHub repository does not include these files as they are generated based on your specific search parameters and preferences. These files can become quite large.*

5. **Verify your orbit cache** (optional - only after you've used the software):
   - run verify_orbit_cache.py

   *Note: The GitHub repository does not include a pre-built cache file. The orbit cache (`orbit_paths.json`) is created automatically as you use the software and fetch data for different solar system objects. This verification step is only useful after you've run the main application and built up some cached data.*

**Initial Setup Tips:**
- Start with a few objects to build your initial JSON cache. The file size will increase as you plot more objects and dates. 
- Use "Fetch Special" mode for experiments
- The software automatically creates backups and maintains cache health

### Using the Enhanced Features

**Planetary Shell Visualization:**
1. Set any planet as the center object
2. Enable shell components (core, mantle, atmosphere, etc.)
3. Observe scientifically accurate internal structure
4. Use different center objects to explore various planetary types

**Mission Tracking:**
1. Select spacecraft from the comprehensive mission list
2. Set appropriate date ranges for mission phases
3. Watch historic missions like Voyager's grand tour
4. Track current missions in real-time

**Lagrange Point Exploration:**
1. Enable Lagrange point visualization
2. Understand gravitational balance points
3. See why L2 is preferred for space telescopes
4. Explore both Earth-Moon and Sun-Earth systems

**Time Controls:**
- Date selector for any moment from January 1, 1900- December 31, 2199 CE (JPL Horizons limits)
- Default to "now" or modify the current date and the default 28 "Days to Plot" (note: the first date is the current date)
   - Or enter the end date you want
- Animation controls: enter the number of frames to animate in minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or years
- Click "Plot Entered Date" for a static plot
- Click one of the animation buttons, then "Play" in the Plotly HTML plot

### Performance Tips

1. **First Run**: 
   - Start with a small selection of objects
   - The cache builds incrementally as you use the software

2. **Optimal Usage**:
   - Use "Fetch Special" for experiments
   - Select only objects you need to plot
   - Use coarser intervals for long time spans

3. **Cache Maintenance**:
   - **Cache is precious data** - treats cached orbit data as a valuable astronomical archive
   - Cache grows as you use the software and serves as backup if JPL Horizons become unavailable or limited
   - **Manual cleanup option**: If your cache gets too large, you can clean data older than 90 days by running Python and calling `from orbit_data_manager import prune_old_data; prune_old_data()` (Developer note: This feature exists but creator avoids using it to preserve data)
   - Run `verify_orbit_cache.py` if you suspect issues, but only repairs corruption (doesn't delete good data)
   - Multiple automatic backups created to protect against data loss

## üîß Configuration & Customization

### Interval Settings

# In palomas_orrery.py - Adjustable default intervals for fetching data

    'Orbital objects': '1d' for closed elliptical orbits like planets, asteroids, trans-neptunian objects, many comets         
    'Trajectory objects': '6h' for open trajectories like space missions, or hyperbolic orbits like some comets or interstellar objects  
    'Satellite objects': '1h' for moon, with typically short elliptical orbital periods   

- if you modify the settings, click "Use updated intervals below to fetch data (will not be cached)" to use them.            

### Planetary Shell Configuration

## üåü Future Development

- As interesting objects come up, for example the new interstellar object 3I/ATLAS (2025), I may implement them using JPL Horizons ephemeris, or new functionality is developed to enhance visualizations. Suggestions are welcome, tonyquintanilla@gmail.com

## üé≠ The Human Touch

While built on rigorous astronomical data and sophisticated algorithms, Paloma's Orrery never loses sight of the human element in space exploration. Every spacecraft has a story, every star has unique characteristics, and every celestial dance unfolds according to the same physical laws that govern our daily lives.

The new planetary shell system allows users to explore the hidden interiors of worlds both familiar and exotic. From Mercury's surprisingly large core to Jupiter's complex atmospheric layers, each visualization tells the story of planetary formation and evolution.

Whether you're tracking Voyager's historic journey to the edge of the solar system or exploring the internal structure of distant worlds, Paloma's Orrery makes the cosmos accessible, beautiful, and endlessly fascinating.
