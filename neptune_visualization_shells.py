def create_neptune_ring_system(center_position=(0, 0, 0)):
    """
    Creates a visualization of Neptune's ring system with proper alignment.
    
    Parameters:
        center_position (tuple): (x, y, z) position of Neptune's center
        
    Returns:
        list: A list of plotly traces representing Neptune's ring components
        
    Notes:
        Neptune's ring system requires specific transformations to correctly align
        with its axial tilt (28.32°) and pole orientation. Unlike Uranus (which has
        an extreme axial tilt of ~98°), Neptune's rings require a different approach.
        
        The transformation uses:
        1. Standard orbital element rotations for each ring
        2. Application of Neptune's pole direction (RA: 299.36°, Dec: 43.46°)
        3. Proper offsetting relative to Neptune's center
