# Interactive Exhibit

Skill version: 1.2 | Cut from gallery @ 9c056d1a (interactive.html,
gallery/nav_cluster.js, gallery/feature_renderers.js) and orrery @
1fa413d9 (LEDGER_CONSOLIDATED.md L-310, L-316, L-317, L-318, L-320)
| 2026-09-11, with Anthropic's Claude Opus 5
v1.2 (L-316, L-318) records what the chrome gained after Tony's phone:
the nav cluster's four arrow buttons and their portrait placement, the
drawer label, and two Plotly rules the build found by reading v2.35.2's
source rather than recalling it -- a scene relayout carries the live
camera, and a hover box keeps its pointer only when it fits to one side.
Earlier: v1.1 (L-291) corrects what Earth step 3 made untrue and adds what its
close taught about carding. The page picks a room from an `EXHIBITS`
table now, not an `EXHIBIT === "<key>"` branch, and four places still
said branch: the anatomy's switch and class rows, step 3, and step
7's picker. Step 3 gains the driver rule the build found by running
the resolver; step 7 gains the check for an existing card and the
order Studio forces; the rename paragraph points at L-309, which
deferred it; one field note.
Earlier: v1.0 cut from gallery @ fc8d9fb3 (interactive.html,
feature_renderers.js, data/objects_config.json, gallery_maintenance_run.py,
tools/gallery_studio.py) and orrery @ a57e86b8 (LEDGER_CONSOLIDATED.md
L-260, L-267, L-278, L-282, L-288, L-289) | 2026-09-06
Written with Anthropic's Claude Fable 5.1 before the Earth exhibit, on
Tony's question "do we have a skill that defines how we build
interactives?" The answer was no; the Sun's pattern lived only as code
and as ledger history. Everything below was read from those files at
the pinned SHAs, not recalled.

## What an exhibit is, and what this skill is not

An exhibit is a ROOM in `interactive.html`, chosen by `?exhibit=<key>`.
It runs the shared `assembler` package in Pyodide against the served
cache (Python assembles the scene), and JavaScript draws the body's
features (`feature_renderers.js`). The Sun (`?exhibit=sun`) is the
worked example and the template; the Solar System Explorer is the
default room and predates the pattern.

Three neighbours own the layers beneath and beside this one:
- gallery-assembler: the propagation math, resolver, cache reader,
  trust system, golden artifacts, Mode 5 as MEASUREMENT, and the rule
  never to mutate a plot from inside a Plotly event handler.
- gallery-cache-builder: how `data/solar-system/` is produced nightly.
- gallery-pipeline: Studio -> json_converter -> index.html for FIGURE
  cards. An exhibit's card is the one place this skill touches Studio.

## The anatomy of an exhibit (the Sun, read at fc8d9fb3; two rows corrected at 1.1)

Named so a new exhibit can be checked piece by piece against the
template. "Shared" means one copy serves every room; "per-body" means
the new exhibit brings its own.

| Piece | Where | Shared or per-body |
|---|---|---|
| `EXHIBIT` switch: `?exhibit=` lower-cased, default `solar-system-explorer`; `EX = EXHIBITS[EXHIBIT]` is the room | interactive.html, `const EXHIBITS` | shared; a new room adds one ROW to `EXHIBITS` -- title, sceneTitle, pngName, halfRangeAu, driver, infoHtml, compose (since Earth step 3, L-291; at fc8d9fb3 it was one `EXHIBIT === "<key>"` branch per room) |
| `body.sun-exhibit` class and `.sun-chrome` show/hide rule, added for EVERY room | `applySunChrome()`, CSS | shared; the name stays `sun` until the rename (L-309) -- at fc8d9fb3 this row read per-body `body.<key>-exhibit` |
| Assembler modules list and the DRIVER: `assemble_scene({domain, content_type, objects, center, epoch}, Catalog(objects_config), CacheReader(coverage_index))` | `SUN_ASSEMBLER_MODULES`, `SUN_DRIVER` | shared code; per-body spec (`objects`, `center`) |
| Data read at boot: `data/solar-system/coverage_index.json`, `data/objects_config.json` | `initSunExhibit()` | shared |
| Feature handoff: `GalleryFeatures.buildFeatureTraces(features, positions, {sceneHalfRangeAu})`; anything larger than the frame goes to the drawer, not dropped | feature_renderers.js | shared |
| Arrival frame: measure every trace once (`sunTraceExtentAu`), half-range = 1.1 x the largest visible, floored at the body's constant (`SUN_HALF_RANGE_AU` 0.25) | initSunExhibit | mechanism shared; the floor and what is visible on arrival are per-body rulings |
| Layout builder: aspect 1:1:1 unless the body's physics says otherwise (the Sun's shells are spheres); axes state their unit; `tick0` 0 and `dtick` from `sunGridDtick(span)` | `buildSunLayout()` | per-body values, shared rules |
| Drawer replacing the legend: rows from `legendgroup`, `legendonly` hides, All / none, focus row; naming a DRAWN shell also opens its hover text as a scene annotation pinned to its info marker, closed by a tap in the scene or by unticking (L-318) | `buildSunDrawer`, `sunApplyVisibility`, `sunFocusOn`, `sunLabelShow`, `sunLabelInstall` | shared |
| Nav cluster: + / - / Home = FRAME zoom (range and dtick change together; the grid re-labels), plus four arrow buttons that turn the camera by a step scaled to the live eye distance, so a tap moves the same slice of screen at any zoom (L-310); on a portrait phone 768 px or narrower the arrow cross moves to the top-right corner, which the hidden mode bar leaves free, and the in-frame title stays (L-316) | gallery/nav_cluster.js (`crossRight`), `navFrameZoom`, `navHome`, `navCameraStep`, `sunCrossRight`, `navPlaceCross` | shared |
| Click deferral: `plotly_click` -> `setTimeout(0)` -> focus | initSunExhibit | shared, CRITICAL (L-278) |
| i-panel follows the focus; curated link per feature stamped into trace `meta` by `stampLink` | `renderSunInfo`, feature_renderers.js | shared mechanism; per-body copy and links |
| Frame HUD: camera-following triad, Aries glyph with the frame note and its source, grid chip | `sunHud*` | shared; reads the camera, never calls Plotly |
| Consent gate and Pyodide load | `loadPyodideRuntime`, `CONSENT_KEY` | shared |
| Back link: "Gallery" steps back in history when the gallery is behind it | BACK TO THE GALLERY block | shared |

The naming carries a debt: most shared pieces are called `sun*` because
the Sun was first. The rule is to rename or parametrize them, never to
copy them under `earth*`. One drawer, one nav cluster, one HUD, one
i-panel; the body is a parameter. Earth, the second room, PARAMETRIZED
through the `EXHIBITS` table and kept the names: a rename touches about
a hundred identifiers in a working room for no change a visitor sees,
and would put the Sun back under Mode 5. It is deferred to the third
room or a free session, with the names to reach for (L-309).

## Rules

### Design before code [QUALITY]
An exhibit starts as a conversation with Tony, zero code: what is in
the arrival frame and what waits in the drawer; the half-range floor;
which of the body's features exist in the served entry today and which
must be added; what is Earth-specific (or Jupiter-specific) chrome, if
anything. Each round gets simpler. The Sun's arrival ruling (core
through outer corona, streamer belt in frame) is the shape of the
answer, not the answer.

### One chrome, many rooms [QUALITY]
Before adding a second room, grep interactive.html for `sun` inside the
shared pieces above and decide, piece by piece: rename, parametrize, or
leave (with a reason). A second copy of the drawer is the Parallel
Pipelines failure one page wide. When a shared piece changes, both
rooms are Mode 5 targets.

### Provenance is part of the build [CRITICAL]
The exhibit renders only what the served entry carries, and every
rendered NUMBER carries its provenance in the served data, not in the
page:

- In `data/objects_config.json`, a measured value sits as
  `{ "value": ..., "unit": ..., "source": "...",
  "orrery_constant": "constants_new.py::NAME" }`. The value is the
  orrery store's value; the pointer names it; the source is the
  published authority. Earth's `planet_radius` at fc8d9fb3 is the
  worked example (IERS 2010, `EARTH_EQUATORIAL_RADIUS_KM`).
- The live maintenance run (`gallery_maintenance_run.py --live`, Store
  drift) follows every pointer into the orrery store at orrery HEAD and
  reports MATCH, DRIFT, or NOT IN STORE, by name. A new exhibit's
  pointers must read MATCH before the exhibit is called done. NOT IN
  STORE is fixed by adding the constant to the store (`constants_new.py`
  is the single value home), never by removing the pointer; DRIFT is a
  finding on whichever side moved.
- Colours, opacities, marker sizes, display names and point counts are
  the DECLARED zone (master plan Section 7 decision 18): style, no
  source expected. Match the orrery's palette so the legend reads the
  same.
- Text CLAIMS the page makes -- the i-panel copy, the frame note --
  carry their source in the page itself, because the assembler does not
  pass through the provenance scanner. The frame note's NAIF citation
  is the form.
- Where a value is unknowable or stylized (a dipole azimuth, the
  streamer belt's warp), the hover says so; silence reads as precision
  the model lacks (Show the Envelope of the Unknowable).
- The Artifact Bounds the Audit, and The Braid orders it: the new
  exhibit's pointers are the slice; a provenance gap found elsewhere
  while building it is recorded, one ledger row per CLASS, not chased.
  This is the same discipline the orrery reached retroactively, applied
  to the assembler as it is built (Tony, 2026-09-06).

### Never mutate a plot from inside a Plotly event handler [CRITICAL]
A relayout from inside `plotly_click` re-enters the update machinery
and the page dies. Defer with `setTimeout(0)`. Full record:
gallery-assembler field note, L-278. Chrome that only READS (the HUD
reads the camera each animation frame) is exempt; anything that calls
`Plotly.*` from an event is not.

### Scene text is scenery [QUALITY]
Anything that must stay legible at every zoom and angle belongs in the
page, not the scene. Text drawn in the scene shrinks with distance, is
clipped at the box boundary, and floats for edges beside the camera
(L-289, first build, failed on the phone). Labels, chips, triads,
notes: page chrome.

### The frame zoom and the grid agree [QUALITY]
`+`, `-` and Home change the range AND the dtick together through one
rule (`sunGridDtick`). The arrival layout must set dtick by the same
rule, or Plotly picks its own and the grid chip disagrees with the grid
(L-289, 2026-09-06: 0.2 vs 0.1 AU on arrival). Mouse-wheel is camera
zoom and leaves the spacing alone by design.

### Aspect is read, not assumed [QUALITY]
Chrome that projects from the camera reads `aspectratio` from the full
layout. 1:1:1 is the Sun's choice, not a law (Tony: "sometimes the ticks
are not isometric").

### Hover text gives km AND AU [QUALITY]
Standing convention inherited from the orrery (orrery-coding-conventions).

### Phone first, and the conditions are stated [QUALITY]
Mode 5 runs portrait on Tony's phone before desktop. Sequence: arrival
frame (what is in view, grid = chip); rotate (triad follows; nothing
floats); + / - / Home and the four arrows (grid re-labels, chip follows;
a tap turns the same slice of screen at any zoom); drawer (a hidden
shell draws and the view rescales to hold it); a shell NAME (focus, the
i-panel, and the label pinned to that shell's marker); a shell tap
(focus, i-panel, link); the HUD note (hover on desktop, tap on phone); Gallery
button then browser back; then landscape; then desktop. Report each
trial with its conditions -- device, orientation, arrival or after
which action -- per gallery-assembler's Mode 5 as Measurement. A
headless run here measures the mechanism; only the phone measures
legibility. Three of five things built in the week of 2026-09-05
changed after Tony's eyes saw them.

### The touch path is not the mouse path [QUALITY]
Plotly fires no camera events during a touch rotation; chrome that
follows the camera reads it directly (`scene._scene.getCamera()`) once
per frame. Touch has no hover; anything that opens on hover opens on
tap and closes on a tap elsewhere. A `hidden` attribute loses to a more
specific display rule; write the hidden rule at least as specific.

**A scene relayout must carry the live camera.** A 3D replot re-applies
the camera stored in the layout (`gl3d/scene.js`, `setViewport`), and a
touch rotation never updates that stored copy. So any `Plotly.relayout`
touching the scene -- opening a label, changing margins -- sends
`scene.camera`, read live, alongside whatever it came to change.
Otherwise the view snaps back to wherever the last mouse event left it.
(L-318, read from plotly.js v2.35.2.)

**A hover box keeps its pointer only when it fits to one side.** Plotly
puts the label to the right of its point if it fits, else to the left if
it fits, else centres it OVER the point with no pointer at all and nudges
it back on screen (`fx/hover.js`). So a wide hover string on a narrow
phone loses the line tying it to its marker, and whether it does depends
on where the marker sits, not on how much room there is. Wrap narrower,
or pin a scene annotation, which always points. (L-318.)

## Adding an exhibit: the order

1. Design round with Tony (above). Record rulings in the ledger item
   before code.
2. Served data: confirm the body's entry in `data/objects_config.json`
   has every feature the design draws, each measured value with
   value / unit / source / orrery_constant; add what is missing to the
   STORE first, then to the entry; confirm the nightly builder covers
   the body (gallery-cache-builder) and `coverage_index.json` lists it.
3. Code: one row in `EXHIBITS`; a driver spec whose `center` is the
   body; the body's half-range floor; the layout builder's per-body
   values; i-panel copy with sources inline. What goes in `objects` is
   whatever the resolver accepts against that centre -- RUN it, do not
   infer it. The Sun room passes `["sun"]`. Earth as an object is
   rejected, because the cache stores it relative to the Sun, so the
   Earth room passes `["moon"]` and Earth's own shells arrive by the
   centre-features path (L-291). Reuse the shared chrome by parameter
   (L-309 on names).
4. Pre-test here: `node --check` on the page script; a stand-in scene
   for chrome that can run without Pyodide (the CDN is blocked in the
   sandbox, so the exhibit itself cannot start here -- say so in the
   handoff).
5. Push; `gallery_maintenance_run.py --live`; Store drift reads MATCH
   for the new pointers, by name.
6. Mode 5 on the phone, sequence above; fix; repeat.
7. Card. FIRST read `gallery/gallery_metadata.json` for a card whose
   `live` already opens `interactive.html?exhibit=<key>`: Studio
   refuses a second one, and a card made some other way may already
   exist. Then Studio -> New Interactive Card (L-288) -> pick the scene
   (`live_scene_urls()` in `tools/json_converter.py` reads the keys of
   the page's `EXHIBITS` table, and the older branch form too) ->
   title, placard, sources -> it lands in Storage -> in the editor,
   File > Reload from disk (an open editor does not see Studio's
   write, and its Save All would write over it) -> place it; featured
   if it belongs on the lobby. Never make an exhibit card with the
   editor's Copy Card to Room: the copy keeps the source card's
   pairing tag (field note 2026-09-10).
8. Ledger: the exhibit's item closes on Tony's Mode 5, not on the push.

## Field notes

- 2026-09-02, L-278: `sunFocusOn` called from inside `plotly_click`
  killed the page with "Maximum call stack size exceeded" on a stack 25
  frames deep. Not recursion; a large array applied as arguments inside
  a half-finished replot. `setTimeout(0)` fixed it. Eight reads to
  attribute; three wrong readings from inferring conditions.
- 2026-09-05, L-289: tick values and axis names drawn as scatter3d text
  on all twelve box edges passed every headless check and failed the
  phone on three counts. Rebuilt as page chrome (triad, chip, note).
- 2026-09-06, L-289: four defects in the rebuild, all from the desktop
  and phone pass: `hidden` beaten by a class rule; grid colours read as
  a second key beside the triad (withdrawn); arrival dtick unset; touch
  rotation fires no camera events. None visible headless.
- 2026-09-05, L-282: the "Gallery" button was a plain link, so Safari's
  back walked into the exhibit from the lobby. history.back() when the
  gallery is behind.
- 2026-09-06, L-288: Studio authors the exhibit's card; the card is a
  placard with an Interactive tag and needs no picture (the lobby
  settled that on the phone).
- 2026-09-10, L-291 step 7: the first Earth card was a COPY -- Copy
  Card to Room on the static Earth-and-Moon portrait, then a live URL
  -- made because the Studio button was not found. It kept the
  portrait's `sibling` stamp, file and size, and index.html's Featured
  rule (a 9:16 card yields to a featured sibling) dropped it from the
  DESKTOP lobby while the phone showed it. The handoff written the
  night before said step 7 had not started: its session never read the
  metadata. A replay of the viewer's rule against the served metadata
  predicted both screens before Tony looked, and was right. Fixed by
  delete, then Studio, then the editor, in that order. The editor's
  Reload from disk existed and was not found either (L-288, L-312).

## Install and verify

Author here: `skills/interactive-exhibit/SKILL.md` in the orrery repo.
Install to the account (Settings > Skills). Run `skills_index.py` so the
manifest in PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md carries the version. Per Stale Skill
= Stop, the session that installs a version cannot verify the install.
1.0 was confirmed by the Earth sessions; the first session after 1.1's
push confirms its loaded copy reads 1.1 before exhibit work.
